# Creating a project using npx create-react-app . --template typescript causes the inability to save project files.


I have to use sudo chmod -R 777 . to enable it. Why is this happening?



If I create the react project using the below command, I can't save the project files which means I can't save the changes I made to the files.

```bash
sudo npx create-react-app . --template typescript
```

I have to use `sudo chmod -R 777 .` to enable it. Why is this happening?


My editor is VSCode and my OS is MacOS `Sonoma 14.4`. I have no idea why this is happening. How can I check this?

結果我的專案檔案編輯都不能存擋，要用 sudo chmod -R 777 .  啟用，這是為什麼，我可以怎麼去查詢
sudo chmod -R 777 .

## Issue: Including `.DS_Store` file in the repository

### Problem
Currently, the `.DS_Store` file is being pushed to the repository. This file is automatically generated by macOS and contains metadata about the directory it resides in. However, it is not necessary for the project and can cause issues when collaborating with others.

### Solution
To prevent the `.DS_Store` file from being included in the repository, it is recommended to add it to the `.gitignore` file. This will ensure that it is not tracked by Git and will not be pushed to the remote repository.
