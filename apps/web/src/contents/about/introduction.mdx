I obtained my Bachelor's degree from [National Central University 🐿️](https://www.ncu.edu.tw/), driven by a *sincere passion* for **Software Engineering 💻.**

My current research interests include ***Programming Language Theory, Operating Systems, and Compilers.*** To gain practical experience, I developed my own Lisp interpreter using `C` <sup>[[Code](https://github.com/1chooo/compiler-101)]</sup> and implemented [***Monkey Programming***](https://monkeylang.org/) Compiler with `GO` <sup>[[Code](https://github.com/1chooo/monkey-prog-lang)]</sup>.

In my spare time, I do workouts 💪🏻, street photography 📸, and tech content writing ✍🏻.

**Self-motivated, Team player, Love coding 👨🏻‍💻**
