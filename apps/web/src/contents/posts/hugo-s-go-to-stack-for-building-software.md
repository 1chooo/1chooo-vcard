Hey there ðŸ‘‹ This is Hugo. Here's a quick summary of my go-to tech stack for software development. My experience comes from being highly active on GitHub, with over 5,000 contributions in 2024 (check it out [here](https://github.com/1chooo?tab=overview&from=2024-12-01&to=2024-12-10)). Additionally, I'll share insights on writing maintainable, clean, and scalable code.

## React

### Function Components

We only use `FC` type when we need to pass and extract children from props [^1]. Otherwise, we use the function declaration. Refer [here](https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/docs/basic/getting-started/function_components/) for a more extensive section explaining why `React.FC` should mostly be avoided.

```tsx {5}
// Avoid
interface Props {
  text?: string;
}
const Heading: React.FC<Props> = ({ text = 'Hello, world!' }) => {
  return <h1>{text}</h1>;
};
```

```tsx {5}
// Prefer
interface Props {
  text?: string;
}
function Heading({text = 'Hello, world!'}: Props) {
  return <h1>{text}</h1>;
}
```

## Python

### Docstring and Type Hint

We must have docstring and type hint for every public class and method/function. The format of the docstring is as follows:

#### Class

```python
class MyClass:
    """summary of class

    Attributes:
        attr1 (int): description of attr1
        attr2 (str): description of attr2

    methods:
        method1: description of method1
    """
    attr1: int
    attr2: str

    def method1(self, arg1: int, arg2: str) -> str:
        """summary of method1

        Args:
            arg1 (int): description of arg1
            arg2 (str): description of arg2

        Returns:
            str: description of return value
        """
        return
```

#### Function

```python
def func(arg1: int, arg2: str) -> str:
    """summary of function

    Args:
        arg1 (int): description of arg1
        arg2 (str): description of arg2

    Returns:
        str: description of return value
    """
    return
```

### Naming Convention

We follow the naming convention as follows:

1. class name: `CamelCase`
2. method/function name: `snake_case`
3. private method/function name: `_snake_case`
4. variable name: `snake_case`
5. private variable name: `_snake_case`
6. read only constant name: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`

## Coding Patterns

### `let` vs `const`

Copy/paste is better than the wrong abstraction [^2].
