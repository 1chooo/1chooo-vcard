Hey there ðŸ‘‹ This is Hugo. Here's a quick summary of my go-to tech stack for software development. My experience comes from being highly active on GitHub, with over 5,000 contributions in 2024 (check it out [here](https://github.com/1chooo?tab=overview&from=2024-12-01&to=2024-12-10)). Additionally, I'll share insights on writing maintainable, clean, and scalable code.

## React

### Function Components

We only use `FC` type when we need to pass and extract children from props [^1]. Otherwise, we use the function declaration. Refer [here](https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/docs/basic/getting-started/function_components/) for a more extensive section explaining why `React.FC` should mostly be avoided.

```tsx {5}
// Avoid
interface Props {
  text?: string;
}
const Heading: React.FC<Props> = ({ text = 'Hello, world!' }) => {
  return <h1>{text}</h1>;
};
```

```tsx {5}
// Prefer
interface Props {
  text?: string;
}
function Heading({text = 'Hello, world!'}: Props) {
  return <h1>{text}</h1>;
}
```


## Coding Patterns

### `let` vs `const`

Copy/paste is better than the wrong abstraction [^2].
